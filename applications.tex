\chapter{Applications}

\section*{Overview}
This chapter details the force-based applications of the circular actuator. Like any soft robot, the circular actuator's silicone exterior conforms to the object it holds and can grab and hold objects without causing damage. This chapter includes applications for a single circular actuator, but controlling more than one would allow for more applications. For a single actuator, first, we documented picking up random objects found in the lab. For round objects of various diameters, we placed the circular actuator inside the object to pick it up from the inside, and for larger objects, we used the negative $\psi$ bending region to grasp these objects from the outside. While picking these objects helps us understand the actuator's capabilities and to further explore blocked force when the actuator develops an eccentricity, we designed an experiment to measure the maximum weight that actuators of each material at varying input pressures could hold when placed inside an object.

\section{Three Random Objects}
Demonstrating its viability as a soft robot, the circular actuators can interact with small objects of any shape without causing damage to the object. For a hollow 3D-printed dodecahedron, the circular actuator, once placed inside, conforms to the object's walls when pressurized. With increasing pressure, the actuator's curvature and circumferential expansion conform to the object, and with pressures inducing a negative $\psi$, the actuator can hold the object above itself. Fig. \ref{fig:3dprintedonend} contains photographs of using a DS20 circular actuator to pick up a 3D-printed hollow dodecahedron placed on the end.

\end{figure}

For objects smaller than the initial bending radius of the circular actuator, simply placing the unpressurized actuator on one side of the object is enough to grab the object. For a box of gloves, a DS20 actuator can self-align with the object with increasing pressure. Fig. \ref{fig:boxofgloves} contains photographs of a DS20 actuator picking up a box of gloves. For this object, we stepped from 0 kPa to a pressure high enough to induce a negative $\psi$ based on the size of the box. The first photograph is of the actuator resting on the box. The second and third photographs are of the actuator mid-pressurization flipping its orientation. The fourth is once the actuator reaches the desired input pressure. Holding the actuator from the center can easily pick up the box. Generating sufficient $\psi$ to conform around the object from rest with increasing pressure without human input showcases the versatility of the circular actuator.

\end{figure}

The circular actuator can more easily conform to the object's radius for large round objects. With increasing pressure, a circular actuator will reach the negative $\psi$ corresponding to the object's size. Once the object restricts the bending angle, increasing the pressure further generates a force on both ends of the actuator corresponding to how much the object is restricting the bending angle. For a volleyball, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:aroundvolleyball}, a DS20 actuator, when held against the volleyball, can conform to the size of the ball and, with enough pressure, generate enough force on each end to be able to pick up the ball when held in the center. Similar to the box of gloves, the second photograph is mid-pressurization, before the volleyball restricts the actuator's bending.

\section{Round Objects}

We used a DS30 actuator and a round container with a 15~cm diameter to show the possibilities of the circular actuators. When placed inside the container, we pressurized the DS30 actuator to 110~kPa, which generated a low enough $\psi$ so that the container walls blocked the actuator. We added weights (clamps and fasteners) to the inside of the container to showcase the actuator's strength. At 110~kPa, the DS30 actuator could hold 380~g inside the container. To hold the container from the outside, we used an input pressure of 165~kPa. We found that the DS30 actuator could hold 420~g inside the container at this pressure. The DS30 actuator could pick up the volleyball (270~g, outer diameter of 20~cm) at 150 kPa. Fig. \ref{fig:ds30roundobjects} contains photographs of a DS30 actuator holding the container and the volleyball. We used Kevlar thread placed around the center of the actuator to pick up the objects.

\section{Picking up a Cup}

Using an object with an internal diameter of 9~cm, smaller than the $\psi_0$ bending radius, we placed circular actuators inside the object. With increasing pressure, we measured the maximum weight actuators of all four materials could hold. This experiment explores how adding internal pressure to the actuator increases the blocked force generated when constrained at a certain eccentricity. For each material, at each pressure increment, we added more weight (using 50~g increments) inside the object until the actuator slipped out of the object when picked up from the center of the actuator. All three actuators (DS20, DS30, and SS40) held 700~g within a pressure range of 0-60~kPa when placed inside the cup. Increasing material stiffness could hold about 50~g more weight for a given input pressure. Fig. \ref{fig:coopercupdata} contains the weight actuators could hold inside the cup for pressures between 20-90~kPa. At pressures higher than 60~kPa, the DS20 actuator buckled in the center and could not maintain contact with the inner walls of the object. The DS30 and SS40 actuators at 80~kPa held 750~g and 800~g, respectively.

\end{figure}

For objects with an inner diameter requiring us to compress the actuator so that it can make contact with both walls of the object, the compression of the actuator itself generates a blocking force on the wall of the object. For the stiffness SS50 actuators, at just 20~kPa, the actuator could pick up 1000~g of weight inside the cup, a significant increase compared to the other materials. Fig. \ref{fig:coopercupphotos} contains photographs of actuators of each material holding increasing weight at different pressures inside a cup.
