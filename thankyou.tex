\section*{Acknowledgements}

They say it takes a village to raise a child. I want to thank the following for supporting me and this research over the past 2.5 years:

Firstly, my advisor, Dr.~Michelle Rosen, for trusting me with leading this work and guiding me along each step of the way.

Brandon Bunt, for starting this project with me as an independent study to design a new soft robot. It took two years of the master's program, and we made it.

Elise Danko, Ruslana Bukalo, Erika Gregory, Sophia Xu, Randel Placino, and Claire Park for iterating the fabrication process and experimentation procedures with me.

Michael Giglia, who taught me more than words can describe about robotic systems and designing robust experimentation procedures.  

Isaiah Rivera, Joya Debi, and Ani Vardanyan for developing software and hardware for experimentation and data collection.

James Malin, who showed me how to navigate academic research. 

I want to thank the person who cleaned the lab. Knowing you would always be there with a smile at the end of each long day made it all possible. 

Douglas Thornhill, Catherine Van West, Jacob Koziej, Jonathan Lu, Ridwan Hussain, and Alice Cruz for being my biggest supporters and friends. Thank you for believing in me and telling me I could do it even when I doubted myself.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and grandparents, who made it possible for me to follow my dreams of living in New York City and studying robotics.
