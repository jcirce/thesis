\section*{Acknowledgements}

They say it takes a village to raise a child. I want to thank the following:

Firstly, my advisor, Dr.~Michelle Rosen, for trusting me with leading this work and guiding me along each step of the way. Brandon Bunt, thank you for starting this project with me as an independent study to design a new soft robot. It took two years of the master's program, and we made it. Elise Danko, Ruslana Bukalo, Erika Gregory, Sophia Xu, Randel Placino, and Claire Park, thank you for iterating the fabrication process and experimentation procedures with me. Isaiah Rivera, Joya Debi, and Ani Vardanyan, thank you for developing software and hardware for experimentation and data collection. Michael Giglia, who taught me more than words can describe about robotics and engineering, thank you for teaching me the past 6 years. James Malin, thank you for showing me how to navigate academic research. Robert Smyth, thank you for entertaining my ideas during complex office hours. Sinisa Janjusevic thank you for machining parts for me. Harrison Tyler and Judy Li, thank you for providing me with materials and equipment at AACE Lab. I want to thank the person who cleaned the lab. Knowing you would always be there with a smile at the end of each long day made it all possible. 

Douglas Thornhill, Catherine Van West, Jacob Koziej, Jonathan Lu, Ridwan Hussain, and Alice Cruz, thank you for being my biggest supporters and friends. Thank you for believing in me and telling me I could do it even when I doubted myself.

Finally, I would like to thank my parents and grandparents, who made it possible for me to follow my dreams of living in New York City and studying robotics.
