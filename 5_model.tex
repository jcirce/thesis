\chapter{Analytical Model}
\section{Preliminary Models}
\subsection{Using Ellipses}
% ellipes of constant length, constant open angle, calculates various a,b that fit spec (this was soooo long ago lol)
\subsection{Constant Curvature, Strain}
% circles constant length, given open angle, calculate strain of innermost piece, relate strain to curvature, trying to understand how strains as curvature decreases

\section{Negative Bending Angles}
defining negative bending angles and how this was a breakthru in the model
\subsection{Strain of Entire Cross Section}
integrating strain across entire cross section assuming constant cross section
\subsection{Stress vs Strain for Silicone}
pain pain pain ~ many nonlinear models 
\subsection{Relating Stress to Pressure}
moments model for non-augmented cross section
\subsection{Augmented Cross Section}
accounting for hoop strain ~~ 
\subsection{Pressure vs Bending Angle for 4 Materials}
here have final model equations explained, analysis of concavity
