\chapter{Measuring Blocked Force}
\label{chapter:blockedforce}

\section{Overview}
Characterizing the blocked force for a soft pneumatic actuator is essential to understanding the behavior. The force the actuator generates when constrained provides insight into possible grasping applications of the robot. During unrestricted bending, the moment from the input pressure is equal to the moment from axial strain along the length of the actuator. If we prohibit axial strain, the internal stress is resolved by an external or blocked force, $F$. Fig.~\ref{fig:justblockedforce} contains Fig.~\ref{fig:modelall}C, in this chapter, we define $F$, the blocked force bending moment generated in response to input pressure, $P$, if we restrict axial strain ($\lambda_{\varphi,\tau}$ and $\lambda_\beta$).

The standard fiber-reinforced actuator's blocked force can be measured by placing the load cell underneath the end of the actuator. With pressure, the actuator begins bending, but since the load cell restricts its motion, the force reading on the load cell is the blocked force of the actuator. Additional materials are placed on the actuator for a more accurate reading to ensure no axial strain \cite{polygerinos_modeling_2015}. This method of measuring and characterizing the blocked force is acceptable for the standard actuator. However, the circular actuator's shape and bending behavior create several challenges when measuring the blocked force. 

This chapter details the equipment, protocols, and the orientation we chose to measure the blocked force at one end of the circular actuator when restricting axial deformation. 

\section{Testing Equipment and Protocols}

We determined that a 2~kg load cell would not saturate while measuring the blocked force when we blocked the actuator from unbending using a small food scale. We used a 2~kg load cell (a14071900ux0069, Uxcell) connected to an amplifier (CJMCU-711 HX711, Cylewet). This amplifier has a digital communication protocol. To communicate between the amplifier and the computer storing the force readings, we used a USB to GPIO converter (CJMCU FT232H, Koobook) and a Python script. At each pressure increment, we took the average of 100 load cell readings to reduce noise. \\

The 1-axis load cell measures a force in a single direction. To calibrate the sensor, we used objects of known weight (often the clamps used for holding the molds together during fabrication). To calibrate the reading from the amplifier and convert it to units of kg, we first took readings with no load to know the bias, then we added objects of known weight using a string to hang it from the load cell. We took several readings at different weights to generate a linear map of the digital reading from the load cell's amplifier to the force applied from the object using gravity. Calibrating the load cell using gravity meant that the load cell must remain pointing in the direction of gravity to ensure accurate readings. 

\section{Iterations on Orientation}

\subsection{Pushing Down on the Load Cell}

For the first attempt at using the load cell to measure the blocked force at the end of the actuator, we fixed the load cell so that it would measure a force normal to the table (in the same direction as gravity). We wanted the flat side of the actuator to touch the load cell before we added pressure. We assumed we could calibrate out the weight of the actuator itself. Fig. \ref{fig:pushingdown} contains photographs taken while we measured blocked force. Because each actuator had a slightly different length from fabrication inconsistencies, the ideal angle of the end with the barb was slightly different for each actuator. We tried holding the fixed end of the actuator at 45 degrees using a metal triangle; the free end could connect with the load cell but not quite in parallel. We also tried holding the barb end perpendicular to the table (in parallel with the direction of the force on the load cell) but faced the same problem.

\end{figure}

Using this method, we could capture force readings, but several factors led to characterizing the blocked force using a different orientation. First, calibrating out the weight of the actuator from the force reading was non-trivial because as we added pressure to the actuator, the stress from axial strain lifted the actuator away from the load cell, decreasing the force reading. Also, as we increased pressure, the end of the actuator would slide along the face of the load cell, changing the orientation of the force from pressure on the end of the actuator and changing the direction of the blocked force. When the end of the actuator was significantly misaligned from the load cell (Fig. \ref{fig:pushingdown}C), since the load cell only captures force in one direction, the reading would not capture the entire blocked force. 

We attempted a few methods of fixing the end of the actuator to the load cell: electric tape, Kevlar thread, and even a 3D-printed jig. Despite helping to maintain the contact between the end of the actuator and the load cell, since the actuator wanted to pull away from the load cell, these additions would also cause a vertical force on the load cell, further complicating the reading. 

\subsection{Pulling Up on the Load Cell}

To ensure the load cell could read the entire blocked force on the end of the circular actuator, we used Kevlar thread to resolve the force into a single axis, the axis of the load cell. By tying the thread around the free end of the actuator and tying the other end to the load cell, we could block some axial deformation and record the force. To align one side of the thread with the axis of the load cell, we used a small bearing mounted to a 3D-printed block. We fixed this block at a suitable height above the load cell. The flange on the bearing helped keep the thread aligned with the actuator and the load cell. This orientation suffered the same problems as measuring the bending angle against gravity. The actuator could bend and twist out of the plane containing the bearing and the load cell. The thread then had the freedom to move in three axes, which could cause the thread to move off of the bearing. Fig \ref{fig:verticalstring} contains photographs of this testing setup. We determined the optimal length of the string by checking if the load cell reading was close to zero at 0.0 psi (the string was not pulling on the actuator).

The orange dashed lines are parallel to the inextensible thread (added for emphasis).}
    \label{fig:verticalstring}
\end{figure}

Using an inextensible thread free to rotate around the bearing did not entirely block the actuator from unbending. However, it did restrict some axial deformation, inducing a non-constant curvature shape of the fiberglass layer. With increasing pressure, the angle of the thread with respect to the axis of the load cell decreased until both halves of the thread were parallel, and the thread would lift off the pulley. Fig \ref{fig:verticalstringangle} contains samples from various pressures of a DS20 actuator blocked with an inextensible thread attached to the load cell over a bearing acting as a pulley. Note how the shape of the actuator becomes less circular with increasing pressure, and the angle between the two pieces of thread reduces until the thread lifts off the pulley.

\subsection{Pulling on the Load Cell while Horizontal}

Similar to the vertical bending angle experiments, when the actuator is fixed vertically (perpendicular to the table), gravity influences the initial bending angle: the weight causes deformation without input pressure, especially for the softer silicones. Additionally, it was challenging to measure the string's length to ensure there was no initial strain in the actuator while the actuator's end was not touching any surfaces. To solve this, we rotated the actuator and allowed the actuator to rest on a piece of aluminum. Having the actuator flat on the aluminum forced the actuator to stay in one plane, removing any off-axis twisting or bending. Just as with the horizontal bending angle experiments, we removed the effect of gravity on the bending, but now friction would inhibit the actuator's motion. Fortunately, during blocked force testing, the actuator's bending angle would not decrease significantly due to the string's restrictions on the end of the actuator, so we tolerated the influence of friction. 

In this testing orientation, the inextensible thread still runs over the pulley. Still, we could add more pressure to the actuator before the string would fall off the pulley compared to the vertical experiments. In this orientation, we measured the length of the thread so that the actuator maintained its initial bending angle and circular shape, and the thread was initially perpendicular to the load cell. With increasing pressure, the thread rotates away from the pulley as the actuator begins to lose its circular shape. As shown in Fig \ref{fig:horizontalblockedforce}A, with pressure ($P > 0$), the angle of the string increases relative to the load cell. Fig \ref{fig:horizontalblockedforce}B contains photographs of a DS20 actuator, highlighting the angle of the thread.
