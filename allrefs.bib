	abstract = {Significance
            Fluid-powered elastomeric soft robots have been shown to be able to generate complex output motion using a simple control input such as pressurization of a working fluid. This capability, which mimics similar functions often found in biology, results from variations in mechanical properties of the soft robotic body that cause it to strain to different degrees when stress is applied with the fluid. In this work, we outline a mechanics- and optimization-based approach that enables the automatic selection of mechanical properties of a fiber-reinforced soft actuator to match the kinematic trajectory of the fingers or thumb during a grasping operation. This methodology can be readily extended to other applications that require mimicking or assisting biological motions.

            Soft actuators are the components responsible for producing motion in soft robots. Although soft actuators have allowed for a variety of innovative applications, there is a need for design tools that can help to efficiently and systematically design actuators for particular functions. Mathematical modeling of soft actuators is an area that is still in its infancy but has the potential to provide quantitative insights into the response of the actuators. These insights can be used to guide actuator design, thus accelerating the design process. Here, we study fluid-powered fiber-reinforced actuators, because these have previously been shown to be capable of producing a wide range of motions. We present a design strategy that takes a kinematic trajectory as its input and uses analytical modeling based on nonlinear elasticity and optimization to identify the optimal design parameters for an actuator that will follow this trajectory upon pressurization. We experimentally verify our modeling approach, and finally we demonstrate how the strategy works, by designing actuators that replicate the motion of the index finger and thumb.},

	abstract = {This study is focused on developing a new dexterous soft robotic gripper with three ﬁngers and an active palm capable of performing in-hand manipulation purposes. This innovative design meets all the dexterous manipulation requirements without any increase in mechanical complexity. In each ﬁnger, the bending position can be modiﬁed and controlled by moving a stiff rod inserted inside the center hole of the ﬁnger. In this way, the effective length of the manipulation can be changed. As a result, these reconﬁgurable ﬁngers provide a more accessible workspace than conventional soft grippers. Besides, a large diversity of the ﬁnger’s shape conﬁgurations results in more dexterity and in-hand manipulation capability. Workspace analysis is accomplished to characterize the advantages of the proposed design. The effectiveness of this soft robotic gripper is validated by different in-hand manipulation experimental tests, including rotation, regrasping, and rolling. The results suggest a promising solution to bridge the design gap between hard and soft robots for dexterous manipulation tasks. The hybrid design carries advantages of these two classes, such as reconﬁgurability, position, and shape control from hard robots, with large degrees of freedom (DOFs), complex deformations, and lightweight from soft robots. Like human manipulation, the palm plays a major role in stable grasping, especially for enhancing the in-hand manipulation capability. Therefore, we also investigate two types of vacuum palms (suction cup and granular particles) to guarantee a wide range of object manipulation tasks that cannot be completely performed by previously suggested soft grippers.},

	abstract = {This work presents the design and test of a novel fabric-based versatile and stiffness-tunable soft gripper integrating soft pneumatic ﬁngers and wrist. The morphology is designed into a compact tuning fork shape (130 · 110 · 260 mm, 389 g) with two bidirectional sheet-shaped soft ﬁngers and a biaxial bidirectional (universal) cylinder-shaped soft wrist. The multi-degree of freedom of soft ﬁngers and wrist makes the gripper versatile and adaptable to gripping objects of various shapes, sizes, and orientations in a wide range. The bidirectional ﬁngers with double-side inﬂatable chambers can tune their gripping stiffness and force by varying the common and differential pressure of the two sides. The wrist can tune its deﬂecting stiffness and force in the same way. Therefore, the gripper can grip objects of various stiffness and weights. The soft gripper is tested to characterize its workspace, stiffness, gripping force, and dynamic response time. Gripping function tests are also performed to evaluate the achieved degree of functions of the gripper. Tests show that the proposed gripper can grip objects in the size of 0–245 mm and in the orientation of -88.2°–90.8° (pitch/roll) with a maximum gripping force of 40 N and a response time of 1.22–1.60 s to force and 0.56–2.61 s to motion, respectively. The gripping stiffness can be tuned in the range of 0.029–0.137 N/mm (i.e., the tunable scope is 79\%) by varying common pressure in the range of 0–0.2 MPa. Functional tests verify that the proposed soft gripper is versatile and adaptable to gripping objects of various shapes, sizes, weights, and orientations. Therefore, the proposed soft gripper has great potential applications in production and daily life.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Soft actuators can be classified into five categories: tendon-driven actuators, electroactive polymers, shape-memory materials, soft fluidic actuators (SFAs), and hybrid actuators. The characteristics and potential challenges of each class are explained at the beginning of this review. Furthermore, recent advances especially focusing on SFAs are illustrated. There are already some impressive SFA designs to be found in the literature, constituting a fundamental basis for design and inspiration. The goal of this review is to address the latest innovative designs for SFAs and their challenges and improvements with respect to previous generations, and to help researchers to select appropriate materials for their application. We suggest seven influential designs: pneumatic artificial muscle, PneuNet, continuum arm, universal granular gripper, origami soft structure, vacuum-actuated muscle-inspired pneumatic, and hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic. The hybrid design of SFAs for improved functionality and shape controllability is also considered. Modeling SFAs, based on previous research, can be classified into three main groups: analytical methods, numerical methods, and model-free methods. We demonstrate the latest advances and potential challenges in each category. Regarding the fact that the performance of soft actuators is dependent on material selection, we then focus on the behaviors and mechanical properties of the various types of silicone that can be found in the SFA literature. For a better comparison of the different constitutive models of silicone materials proposed and tested in the literature, ABAQUS software is here employed to generate the engineering and true strain-stress data from the constitutive models, and compare them with standard uniaxial tensile test data based on ASTM412. Although the figures presented show that in a small range of stress–strain data, most of these models can predict the material model acceptably, few of them predict it accurately for large strain-stress values. Sensor technology integrated into SFAs is also being developed, and has the potential to increase controllability and observability by detecting a wide variety of data such as curvature, tactile contacts, produced force, and pressure values.},

Driven by this background, flexible large curvature folding butterfly (Polyura eudamippus) proboscises were studied in this work. The folding ratio of the proboscises was about 15. The curvature of coiled proboscises ranged from about 150 m−1 to 880 m−1. The external and internal structures of the proboscises were studied by different methods. Three main strategies for large-curvature folding of proboscises were identified: a gradual decrease in thickness, a lower elastic modulus, and (most importantly) large numbers of regular corrugated cracks arranged on the surface. These corrugated cracks can effectively accommodate the coiled strain and provide space for the large curvature folding of proboscises. Finally, a 4D printed coiled sample with corrugated cracks was fabricated to mimic the proboscises stretching process. Large-curvature folding strategies, based on these proboscises, provide insights for the biomimetic design of artificial highly folded components.},

In this paper, the principle of operation of these actuators is comprehensively analyzed and described through experimentally validated quasi-static analytical and ﬁnite-element method models for bending in free space and force generation when in contact with an object. This study provides a set of systematic design rules to help the robotics community create soft actuators by understanding how these vary their outputs as a function of input pressure for a number of geometrical parameters. Additionally, the proposed analytical model is implemented in a controller demonstrating its ability to convert pressure information to bending angle in real time. Such an understanding of soft multimaterial actuators will allow future design concepts to be rapidly iterated and their performance predicted, thus enabling new and innovative applications that produce more complex motions to be explored.},

In this article, we describe the design of a composite actuator, the soft-elastic composite actuator (SECA), to facilitate both ﬁnger ﬂexion and extension. A double-segmented SECA comprising two serially connected ﬁber-reinforced actuators with two bottom torquecompensating layers was fabricated. The SECA bends and extends by pneumatic actuation, and the torquecompensating layers offer an assistive bending moment to conﬁgure the bending moment inside the SECA. The principles associated with selection of the torque-compensating layer are described. Analytical models were established to quantify the input pressure and the bending angle of SECA with free bending and when placed on a model compromised hand. The analytical models were validated experimentally and by the ﬁnite element method. Moreover, a stroke survivor was recruited to test the new robotic glove integrated with the multiple double-segmented SECA. The robotic glove facilitated hand opening and closing by the patient, and successfully assisted with grasp of a Chinese chess piece and twisting of a towel.},

	abstract = {Much of the research on bioinspired soft robotics has focused on capturing the interplay of biological form and function. However, existing soft robotic actuators are mostly made with linear or planar fabrication orientations that do not represent the resting geometry of complex biological systems, such as curved musculature. This work introduces the ability to create ﬁber-reinforced actuators with precurved conﬁgurations. By tuning variables such as dimensions and ﬁber angles, an optimization algorithm can prescribe the mechanical fabrication parameters to create a ﬁber-reinforced actuator that can generate controlled motion to follow a desired input trajectory. Precurved conﬁgurations introduce an additional optimization parameter, the initial bend angle, allowing for a more accurate and robust algorithm and generating a median percent error of {\textless}1\%. With a customized software tool, we can take existing motion data from biological systems—such as medical imaging—and build soft robotic actuators optimized to replicate these trajectories. We can predict the motion of precurved actuators both analytically and numerically and replicate the motion experimentally, with excellent trajectory matching between the three. In constructing actuators that better match the native forms found within biological systems, we ﬁnd that precurved actuators are more efﬁcient than their initially straight counterparts. This pneumatic efﬁciency allows for the use of control systems with lower power and precision, lowering the economic cost of the associated control hardware, while more accurately replicating the biological motion. Taking two examples from biology, that of the human diaphragm during respiration and that of a jellyﬁsh bell during locomotion, we design and generate ﬁber reinforced actuators to mimic these motions.},

	abstract = {Fluidic mechanisms have stimulated research and development in minimally invasive surgery instrumentations, because of their good performance in limited size and their force/torque generation with respect to other types of actuation systems. Fluidic solutions can be divided in two major classes: (i) elastic ﬂuidic actuators and (ii) piston–cylinder actuators. Elastic ﬂuidic actuators generate lower forces with smaller displacements; nevertheless, piston–cylinder solutions require seals, which can generate friction and require maintenance costs for a good reliability. The proposed solution is based on a hybrid soft–rigid actuation, which aims to overcome the limitations of both previous solutions while preserving the main advantages of the overall ﬂuidic approach. This approach results in very compact, powerful, and low-cost actuators, which are highly customizable and adaptable to speciﬁc constraints, in medical applications but even beyond. This article proposes a novel design of hybrid soft–rigid actuators to be used as basic mechanical joints for enabling pitch and roll degrees of freedom for a miniature robotic arm. Forces up to 1.4 N and up to 2.77 N have been obtained for the above joints, respectively, and even better performance can be reached (up to 3 N) with further improvements, as demonstrated in this article.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is one of the deadliest forms of cancers and is often diagnosed by performing biopsies with the use of a bronchoscope. However, this diagnostic procedure is limited in ability to explore deep into the periphery of the lung where cancer can remain undetected. In this study, we present design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of a one degree of freedom soft robot with integrated diagnostic and interventional capabilities as well as vision sensing. The robot can be deployed through the working channel of commercial bronchoscopes or used as a stand-alone system as it integrates a micro camera to provide vision sensing and controls to the periphery of the lung. The small diameter (2.4 mm) of the device allows navigation in branches deeper in the lung, where current devices have limited reachability. We have performed mechanical characterizations of the robotic platform, including blocked force, maximum bending angle, maximum angular velocity, and workspace, and assessed its performance in in vitro and ex vivo experiments. We have developed a computer vision algorithm, and validated it in in vitro conditions, to autonomously align the robot to a selected branch of the lung and aid the clinician (by means of a graphical user interface) during navigation tasks and to perform robot-assisted stabilization in front of a lesion, with automated tracking and alignment.},

	abstract = {Soft Pneumatic Actuators (SPAs) are customizable and conformable devices that enable desired motions in soft robots. Interactions with the environment or handling during their fabrication could introduce defects into SPAs that affect their performance. These defects could lead to high-stress concentrations in the SPAs body and heterogeneous, unrepeatable, or inconsistent expansion affecting their reliability. In this work, we aim to improve the reliability of soft robots by modeling and characterizing the performance of SPAs with widely used chamber shapes and cross-sectional geometries under variable loading conditions. We also compare their capacity to provide homogeneous, repeatable and time-wise consistent expansion with low-stress concentrations and provide a set of principles for the design of reliable SPAs. Expansion of SPAs with Straight chambers demonstrated to be more repeatable, with an average deviation of 0.06 mm and showed more than a thousand times less stress than any other chamber types. The expansion of preshaped SPAs with Helical chambers showed to be up to 500\% more homogeneous and 300\% more efﬁcient than their deﬂected counterparts. SPAs with squared cross-sectional geometries displayed more than a 1000 times more time-wise consistent expansion over their circular counterparts. We conclude that SPAs that retain less potential energy or are less affected by its effects are more reliable. We derive these results into a set of principles for the design of reliable SPAs. These principles offer solutions to make informed decisions prior to fabrication to mitigate the most common reliability problems for SPAs and soft robots.},

	abstract = {A theoretical model is built in this study for analyzing and predicting the deformation of a bending-type soft pneumatic actuator used for bionic robotic ﬁsh. The actuator is composed of two symmetrically distributed silicone rubber blocks (Ecoﬂex0030 from Smooth-on Co., Ltd.). Between the two rubber blocks, an ABS plate is ﬁxed to work as a neutral layer. When one side of the actuator is inﬂated, it consequently bends toward the uninﬂated side. The deformation of the actuator on the inﬂated side and the uninﬂated side, respectively, is analyzed based on principles of elasticity mechanics. The deformation on the inﬂated side is simpliﬁed to planar type and is decomposed into two mutually perpendicular directions to analyze the stress state. A two-step deforming process is proposed to study the stress state on the uninﬂated side. The two components are combined to determine the relationship between the bending angle of the actuator and the actuating pressure. The proposed model is compared with a ﬁnite element analysis model in which the same constraint, load, and materials are used. An experiment under the same conditions was implemented to validate the model. The experiment demonstrates that the accuracy of the theoretical model is adequate to indicate the response of the soft pneumatic actuator to the actuating pressure. A bionic ﬁshtail system based on the soft pneumatic actuator was also established to verify the applicability of the actuator to bionic robotic ﬁsh.},

	abstract = {Soft robots exhibit many exciting properties due to their softness and body compliance. However, to interact with the environment safely and to perform a task effectively, a soft robot faces a series of challenges such as dexterous motion, proprioceptive sensing, and robust control of its deformable bodies. To address these issues, this article presents a method for fabrication and dynamic modeling of a novel bidirectional bending soft pneumatic actuator that embeds a curvature proprioceptive sensor. The bidirectional bending deformation was generated by two similar chambers with a sinusoidal shape for reducing the internal dampness during bending deformation. An optical waveguide made from ﬂexible poly (methyl methacrylate) material that is immune to the inlet pressure was embedded into the actuator body to measure its bending angle. A dynamic modeling framework based on step response and parameter ﬁtting was proposed to establish a simple differential equation that can describe the nonlinear behavior of the soft actuator. Hence, a sliding mode controller is designed based on this differential equation and the Taylor expansion. The proposed dynamical model and the sliding mode controller were validated by trajectory tracking experiments. The performance of the bidirectional bending soft actuator, such as the linear output of the curvature sensor in different inﬂating patterns, the proprioceptive sensitiveness to the external environment, the output force, and large bending range under relatively small pressure, was evaluated by relevant experimental paradigms. Prototypes from the novel design and fabrication process demonstrated the soft actuator’s potential applications in industrial grasping and hand rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Deformation behavior of soft pneumatic actuators (SPAs) can mechanically be preprogrammed into their architecture during design. To date, the majority of SPAs rely on a unimodal bending design. This paper develops a method of including a bimodal design into the deformed state by means of a bilinear material that replaces the conventional strain limiter. With a simple increase in pneumatic pressure, it is possible to have distinctly different deformation directions in one actuator. While inﬂating at low pressures, the actuator has a preferential deformation direction. As the pressure continues to increase, this preferential deformation direction changes due to a change in the stiffness of the strain limiter. An example of this behavior is demonstrated by an actuator that initially bends in one direction, but then gradually changes direction in plane as the pressure continues to increase. Three different physical actuators were manufactured, tested, and correlated with preliminary numerical models. The physical and numerical models exhibited the desired bimodal behavior, although at different pressures. Furthermore, it was possible to alter the pressure at which this transition occurs by changing the crimp ratio of the embedded bilinear material.},

These units are constructed to have a preferential bending direction using Mold Star 15 and Smooth-Sil 950 silicone.

This design tool optimizes the design using the genetic information available in the initial population over multiple generations and presents a candidate design that best resembles a desired proﬁle speciﬁed as the objective function. A two-dimensional reduced order model was developed that reduces the time for each function evaluation from \&20 min for a three-dimensional (3D) numerical analysis to \&45 s. The design tool was tasked to solve design targets ranging from sine and cosine functions of various amplitudes to ﬁnal actuator tip positions. In each case, the inﬂated actuator resembled the desired proﬁle. Selected physical actuators were cast and tested. 3D scanning was used to capture the inﬂated shape and compared it to the numerical solution. A quantitative comparison showed a maximum average deviation of {\textless}2.5\% of the uninﬂated actuator length between the physical and numerical models.

The antagonistic actuators together compose a bidirectional bending actuator with embedded capacitive strain sensors. By designing the SCAPAs from the groundup for closed-loop control, we are able to minimize both the number of constituent components and the types of materials used, and further streamline the manufacturing processes. These improvements are embodied in the multipurpose use of a single conductive fabric sheet for both actuation and sensing, integrated into an otherwise all-silicone device. Such reduced material complexity allows us to use simple ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) models to predict the performance of a given design. We compare various designs to maximize sensor effectiveness using FEA and experimentally verify the suitability of select designs for state reconstruction. After converging on our ﬁnal design, we demonstrate that this design evaluation process enables the use of simple control strategies to achieve closed-loop control.},

Several soft actuators were fabricated and their displacement and force capabilities were measured experimentally and compared to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Finally, a prototype two-digit endeffector was designed and programmed with the conformal covering to shape match a rectangular object.

However, flexible actuators are mainly made of silica gel and rubber, which are supplemented by fabric and nylon thread to limit displacement. It takes a lot of time to make silica gel flexible actuators. This paper presents a novel flexible bi-directional bending actuators with large angle made by Aluminized Polyester materials (AP) and Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using CO2 laser. In this paper, different reinforced structures are designed to limit the radial expansion of actuators. This paper aims to determine the relationship between gas pressure and bending angle under different chamber’s width. The actuators have simple process and excellent performance, which brings new research ideas for the design and manufacture of light and thin soft actuators. A novel soft manipulator was made by this actuator which can lift some objects.},

The complexity of the actuator geometry and the nonlinear stress–strain behavior of the stretchable material during inﬂation make it diﬃcult to predict actuator performance prior to prototype fabrication. In this work, a scalable modular elastic air-driven actuator made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is developed for a mechanically compliant robotic gripper that grasps individual horticultural plants and fungi during automated harvesting. The key geometric design parameters include the expandable surface area and wall thickness of the deformable structure used to make contact with the target object. The impact of these parameters on actuator displacement is initially explored through simulation using the Mooney–Rivlin model of hyperelastic materials. In addition, several actuator prototypes with varying expandable wall thicknesses are fabricated using a multistep soft-lithography molding process and are inserted in a closed ring assembly for experimental testing. The gripper performance is evaluated in terms of contact force, contact area with the target, and maximum payload before slippage. The viability of the gripper with PDMS actuators for horticultural harvesting applications is illustrated by gently grasping a variety of mushroom caps.},

            This work presents multiple methods of creating high aspect ratio fluidic soft actuators that can be formed individually or in large arrays via dip coating. Within this methodology, four strategies are provided to mechanically program the motion of these actuators, including the use of fiber inclusions, gravity, surface tension, and electric fields. The modular nature of this dip coating fabrication technique is inexpensive, easy to modify, and scalable. These techniques are used to demonstrate the fabrication of soft actuators with aspect ratios up to 200:1 and integrated arrays of up to 256 actuators. Furthermore, these methods have the potential to achieve higher aspect ratios and larger array sizes. Operating pressure, curvature, and curling strength tests reveal the design space in which fabrication parameters can be selected to tune the input and output parameters of soft bending actuators. An individual bending actuator made with these methods weighs between 0.15 and 0.5 g, can hold up to 2 N, and can be designed to work in groups to increase curling strength with distributed contact forces. Arrays of these actuators may be useful in atypical grasping and manipulation tasks, fluid manipulation, and locomotion.},

The numerical bending angle results from the proposed gray-box model, and the corresponding experimental results match well that the model is accurate enough to predict the bending behavior of this class of pneumatic soft actuators. Further, by using the experimental bending angle results and blocking force results, the effective modulus of elasticity of the actuators is estimated from a blocking force model. The numerical and experimental results presented show that the bending angle and blocking force models are valid for this class of pneumatic actuators. Another contribution of this study is to incorporate a bistable ﬂexible thin metal typiﬁed by a tape measure into the topology of the actuators to prevent the deﬂection of the actuators under their own weight when operating in the vertical plane.},

However, a rigid robotic arm is seldom used by people in daily life, as the cost is usually high and, most importantly, its rigidity, large weight, and noncompliance can cause safety concerns when it comes to human–robot interaction. Therefore, we want to build a robotic arm that is cheap, lightweight, and provides safe interaction with humans. This soft inﬂatable robotic arm, which is made from low-cost fabrics and ﬂexible plastics, is a promising solution for a domestic robotic arm. The softness and natural compliance can guarantee safe interaction with people. In this letter, we present our soft robotic arm (SRA) made from nylon fabric. The SRA contains two joints that can bend the arm vertically and horizontally, and a gripper as an end-effector that can pick up objects of different shapes and sizes. The SRA has the advantages of low cost, good portability, and adequate force output. We characterized the bending modality and force output and demonstrated the functionality of the SRA in object manipulation. This fabric-based soft robotic arm is promising for use in assisting people’s daily activities, for example, mounting on a wheelchair to enable a wheelchair bound person to reach objects from a distance.},

The 2-DOF thumb design allows for a range of precision and power grasps, enabling the DragonClaw to complete a modified Kapandji test for dexterous ability. The operating range of the gripper is characterized through experiments on grip strength and finger blocking force. Further, the integrated magnetic sensor, ReSkin, is successfully demonstrated in a closed-loop control task to respond to external disturbances. Finally, the documentation, bill of materials, and detailed instructions to replicate the DragonClaw are made available on the DragonClaw website, encouraging people with wide ranging expertise to reproduce this work.

	abstract = {Soft bending actuators are being used in many applications such as in soft robotics and medical devices due to their compliant behavior and safe interaction. These soft actuators are mainly actuated by pneumatic pressure because of cleaner and safer operations while dealing with delicate objects and human. A soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) with multi-chambered structure is more efficient than a single chamber SPA. In this paper, a multi-chambered SPA is designed and studied experimentally. The designed SPA is fabricated using two different soft hyperelastic materials namely, Ecoflex-0030 and Ecoflex-0050. The fabrication process utilized the 3D printing and casting techniques. From the experimental studies, it is found that the SPA fabricated using Ecoflex-0050 shows more uniform bending. Therefore, this SPA is further utilized for developing a soft pneumatic gripper for the robotic application. Three fingers of Ecoflex0050 SPA are used for the soft robotic gripper, which is tested experimentally for handling delicate objects. From the experiments, it has been observed that the developed SPA is able to grasp and hold objects of different shapes and sizes with a load carrying capacity of approximately 650 gm.},

	abstract = {Most soft pneumatic actuators for producing bending actuation have made use of either positive or negative pressure and adjusted their design in consequence. In the proposed paper, a novel soft bending actuator using combined positive and negative pressures (PNP) where the bending force of a negative pressure actuator and a positive pressure actuator is combined into a single actuating structure. This actuator is capable of producing a blocked force as high as 150 N at a combined positive pressure of 60 kPa and negative pressure of 60 kPa while still being able to produce large bending deformations. It was found that the equilibrium angle of PNP actuation is lower than using only negative pressure but that the actuator can produce larger forces at angles below the equilibrium angle of using positive pressure only. The actuator can use PNP actuation to produce large forces at lower bending angles and negative pressure actuation for producing large bending angles. This actuator was implemented in a soft robotic gripper capable of lifting large objects weighing up to 4 kg and a soft pinching gripper capable of holding a notebook weighing 1.85 kg by pinching it. The proposed actuator is capable of large forces and is versatile such that it is expected to be used in applications such as agriculture where many objects tend to be large and heavy yet require a delicate touch.},

Herein, under the inspiration of the elephant trunk, a family of bending and helical extensile PAMs (HE-PAMs)/helical contractile PAMs (HC-PAMs) was proposed and analyzed. Through both experiment and analysis, a model of generalized bending behavior of PAMs was built and developed to investigate the properties of axial, bending, and helical PAMs in the same theoretical framework. The topological equivalence and bifurcation were found in the analysis and utilized to explain the behaviors of these different PAMs. Meanwhile, a coupled constant curvature and torsion kinematics model was proposed to depict the motion of PAMs more accurately and conveniently. Moreover, a soft tandem manipulator consisting of bending and helical PAMs was proposed to demonstrate their attractive potential.},

An ideal soft gripper would exhibit universal gripping with high gripping force and consists of low-cost materials with simple fabrication processes. This paper investigates the development of a strong and scalable hydraulic soft tubular gripper (HSTG) using facile fabrication method and low-cost materials. The HSTG which consists of a single long hydraulically actuated artificial muscle, soft 3D printed element, and commercial weaving yarn can expand and contract its orifice to grasp objects using a miniature hydraulic syringe. Grasping experiments show that the new HSTG can successfully grasp convex, nonconvex, and flat objects as well as the ones with cavity. The soft gripper uniquely exhibits high normal contact force at minimal pressure and energy use due to the nature of its working principle. A 26 g HSTG can produce at least 40 N of gripping force, can hold at least 88 N in external gripping mode ({\textasciitilde}346 times of its weight), 0.34 N in internal mode, and 1.74 N in suction gripping mode. The design and mechanical properties of its components can be fine-tuned to produce tailored performance for different grasping tasks.},

And the research of pneumatic soft robotic grippers has ﬂourished greatly in recent years. However, there is still no effective platform available for robotic manipulation task simulation when equipped with such a deformable gripper. This paper intends to demonstrate a simple but effective approach of how to create simulator of robotic system with soft gripper and implement robot control in a short time. Here we build this platform based on Robot Operation System (ROS) and Gazebo engine. First, we deﬁne an uniﬁed module description format for gripper conﬁgurations. Then, a dynamic model is formulated to control the action of each joints and gripper deformation after simulated pneumatic actuation. Finally, the entire simulation system including modeling, kinematics, control, and visualization is established. Experimental results from pick\&place manipulation of several irregular objects have shown that the proposed simulation platform could achieve an easy conﬁguration, good integration and functional visualization for task simulation of robotic system equipped with a soft pneumatic gripper, and provide a ﬂexible technique for quick veriﬁcation of prototype or algorithms in the research of soft robotics.},

The gripper is based on a Soft Cubic Module (SCM), which has been designed for a variety of applications in a single-block or multiblock arrangements. For PASCAV, an internal chamber in SCM is pneumatically operated to generate a suction effect, which makes the gripper able to grasp objects. The surfaces of the chamber’s soft walls enwrap and stick to the target surface, generating sufficient grip to grasp and uphold the object. The preliminary findings demonstrate its ability to grip a range of objects with flat and, uneven or curved surfaces. The approach is successful for objects that fit the size of the actuating vacuum chamber and the designed payload with respect to the size of the cube, hence making it scalable depending upon the application. We describe the development of the gripper and evaluation of its structure and behavior presenting experimental results. The actuation behavior has also been validated based on the finite element analysis (FEA). The results endorse the simple and cost-effective functional design of PASCAV gripper.},

            Shape memory alloy (SMA) wire-based soft actuators have had their performance limited by the small stroke of the SMA wire embedded within the polymeric matrix. This intrinsically links the bending angle and bending force in a way that made SMA-based soft grippers have relatively poor performance versus other types of soft actuators. In this work, the use of free-sliding SMA wires as tendons for soft actuation is presented that enables large increases in the bending angle and bending force of the actuator by decoupling the length of the matrix and the length of the SMA wires while also allowing for the compact packaging of the driving SMA wires. Bending angles of 400° and tip forces of 0.89 N were achieved by the actuators in this work using a tendon length up to 350 mm. The tendons were integrated as a compact module using bearings that enables the actuator to easily be implemented in various soft gripper configurations. Three fingers were used either in an antagonistic configuration or in a triangular configuration and the gripper was shown to be capable of gripping a wide range of objects weighing up to 1.5 kg and was easily installed on a robotic arm. The maximum pulling force of the gripper was measured to be 30 N.},

Two use pneumatic actuation (the gripper with chambered ﬁngers and the jamming gripper), while the other two employ electromechanical actuation (the tendon driver gripper and the gripper with passive structure). For the experiments, a group of twelve objects with different mechanical and geometrical properties have been selected. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of the environmental conditions on the grippers, by testing each object in three different environments: normal, humid, and dusty. The aim of this comparative study is to show the different performances of different grippers tested under the same conditions.

            Here, a soft robotic microgripper is presented that consists of a smart actuated microgel connected to a spatially photopatterned multifunctional base. When pressed onto a target object, the microgel component conforms to its shape, thus providing a simple and adaptive solution for versatile micromanipulation. Without the need for active visual or force feedback, objects of widely varying mechanical and surface properties are reliably gripped through a combination of geometrical interlocking mechanisms instantiated by reversible shape‐memory and thermal responsive swelling of the microgel. The gripper applies holding forces exceeding 400 µN, which is high enough to lift loads 1000 times heavier than the microgel. An untethered version of the gripper is developed by remotely controlling the position using magnetic actuation and the contractile state of the microgel using plasmonic absorption. Gentle yet stable robotic manipulation of biological samples under physiological conditions opens up possibilities for high‐throughput interrogation and minimally invasive interventions.},

	abstract = {A lot of research is conducted in the area of gripper on manipulator arm. They still use hard robot technology made from rigid material. Hard gripper will be difficult when it is used to grasp and hold fragile objects such as eggs or grapes. Recently, many engineers and scientists who work in robotics in the world have developed soft robot technology that is applied to the gripper. In this paper, we present the development of three-fingered soft robotic griper based on pneumatic networks. Soft robotics fingers are manufactured using elastomeric material; silicon rubber (RTV 52). Soft finger molding material is produced using Polylactic acid (PLA) material and printed using 3D printer. The gripper can perform in a positive and negative pressure room. The actuator utilized in the soft robotic gripper is a mini air compressor. The performance of the proposed soft robotic gripper is tested for various grasping objects from hard to fragile objects in positive and negative pressure. Based on the test result, the developed soft gripper can take and grasp hard and delicate objects that have a mass less than 500 gr under positive pressure.},

However, low capacity in force and load limits their applications. Prestored elastic energy can improve the capacity in output force and load of soft actuators. This work introduces a soft pneumatic bistable reinforced actuator inspired by the Venus Flytrap’s bistable mechanism that allows for the storage of elastic energy. The proposed actuator consists of two separated 3D-printed actuation chambers that are attached to a central prestressed steel shell to achieve bistability. The pressure triggering the pneumatic bistable reinforced actuator from one stable state to the other is derived and validated by experiments. Further experimental comparisons between the proposed actuator and a dual chamber actuator show that the proposed design signiﬁcantly improves the block tip force, load capacity and stiffness. The pneumatic bistable reinforced actuator also demonstrates superior performance in the actuation speed and bending angle under the same input pressure. Finally, a two-ﬁnger gripper is developed using the proposed actuator, which is demonstrated to grasp and hold various objects.},

	abstract = {Soft bending actuators, as one of the most important components of soft robotics, have attracted significantly increasing attention due to their robustness, compliance, inherent safety, and ease of manufacture. However, the key disadvantages can be the low output force, slow response speed, large deformation and vibration, which can potentially be addressed by introducing a bistable mechanism enabled by a prestressed steel shell. This work proposes a novel soft actuator with bistable property, which can maintain the predefined initial state and enhance bending motion at the corresponding stable state. A novel dual-actuation mechanism, which utilises pneumatic pressure for closing and tendon-driven for opening process, is proposed for autonomous transition between both states, and for a fast response. Mathematical model is proposed and compared with the experimental result for triggering pressure, which serves as a threshold to activate the transition of the stable state. Experimental results also indicate that closing and opening speeds are enhanced by 9.82\% and more than ten times, respectively, as compared with the existing pneumatic bistable reinforced actuator design. Mathematical and experimental results suggest that a programmable bending angle at the second stable state can also be achieved by adjusting the preset tendon extension. The tendon arrangement also acts as a passive damping mechanism to reduce the oscillation while closing. The damping ratio is increased by more than four times, indicating that the oscillation decay is significantly accelerated for quick stabilization. Finally, a three-finger soft gripper is developed based on the proposed actuator design, which demonstrates promising performance in grasping objects with various shapes and sizes. The experimental results also show that the proposed bistable gripper can grasp the object with a weight up to 2067 g, which is more than 17 times heavier than that of three actuators.},

	abstract = {The 20th century’s robotic systems have been made out of stiff materials and much of the developments in the field have pursued ever more accurate and dynamic robots which thrive in industrial automation settings and will probably continue to do so for many decades to come. However, the 21st century’s robotic legacy may very well become that of soft robots. This emerging domain is characterized by continuous soft structures that simultaneously fulfil the role of robotic link and robotic actuator, where prime focus is on design and fabrication of the robotic hardware instead of software control to achieve a desired operation. These robots are anticipated to take a prominent role in delicate tasks where classic robots fail, such as in minimally invasive surgery, active prosthetics and automation tasks involving delicate irregular objects. Central to the development of these robots is the fabrication of soft actuators to generate movement. This paper reviews a particularly attractive type of soft actuators that are driven by pressurized fluids. These actuators have recently gained substantial traction on the one hand due to the technology push from better simulation tools and new manufacturing technologies including softlithography and additive manufacturing, and on the other hand by a market pull from the applications listed above. This paper provides an overview of the different advanced soft actuator configurations, their design, fabrication and applications.},

            The proliferation of soft robotics research worldwide has brought substantial achievements in terms of principles, models, technologies, techniques, and prototypes of soft robots. Such achievements are reviewed here in terms of the abilities that they provide robots that were not possible before. An analysis of the evolution of this field shows how, after a few pioneering works in the years 2009 to 2012, breakthrough results were obtained by taking seminal technological and scientific challenges related to soft robotics from actuation and sensing to modeling and control. Further progress in soft robotics research has produced achievements that are important in terms of robot abilities—that is, from the viewpoint of what robots can do today thanks to the soft robotics approach. Abilities such as squeezing, stretching, climbing, growing, and morphing would not be possible with an approach based only on rigid links. The challenge ahead for soft robotics is to further develop the abilities for robots to grow, evolve, self-heal, develop, and biodegrade, which are the ways that robots can adapt their morphology to the environment.},

	abstract = {Octopuses can employ their tapered arms to catch prey of all shapes and sizes due to their dexterity, ﬂexibility, and gripping power. Intrigued by variability in arm taper angle between different octopus species, we explored the utility of designing soft actuators exhibiting a distinctive conical geometry, compared with more traditional cylindrical forms. We ﬁnd that these octopus-inspired conical-shaped actuators exhibit a wide range of bending curvatures that can be tuned by simply altering their taper angle and they also demonstrate greater ﬂexibility compared with their cylindrical counterparts. The taper angle and bending curvature are inversely related, whereas taper angle and applied bending force are directly related. To further expand the functionality of our soft actuators, we incorporated vacuum-actuated suckers into the actuators for the production of a fully integrated octopus arm-inspired gripper. Notably, our results reveal that because of their enhanced ﬂexibility, these tapered actuators with suckers have better gripping power than their cylindrical-shaped counterparts and require signiﬁcantly larger forces to be detached from both ﬂat and curved surfaces. Finally, we show that by choosing appropriate taper angles, our tapered actuators with suckers can grip, move, and place a remarkably wide range of objects with ﬂat, nonplanar, smooth, or rough surfaces, as well as retrieve objects through narrow openings. The results from this study not only provide new design insights into the creation of next-generation soft actuators for gripping a wide range of morphologically diverse objects but also contribute to our understanding of the functional signiﬁcance of arm taper angle variability across octopus species.},

In this article, we describe the design of a composite actuator, the soft-elastic composite actuator (SECA), to facilitate both ﬁnger ﬂexion and extension. A double-segmented SECA comprising two serially connected ﬁber-reinforced actuators with two bottom torquecompensating layers was fabricated. The SECA bends and extends by pneumatic actuation, and the torquecompensating layers offer an assistive bending moment to conﬁgure the bending moment inside the SECA. The principles associated with selection of the torque-compensating layer are described. Analytical models were established to quantify the input pressure and the bending angle of SECA with free bending and when placed on a model compromised hand. The analytical models were validated experimentally and by the ﬁnite element method. Moreover, a stroke survivor was recruited to test the new robotic glove integrated with the multiple double-segmented SECA. The robotic glove facilitated hand opening and closing by the patient, and successfully assisted with grasp of a Chinese chess piece and twisting of a towel.},

	abstract = {In the ﬁeld of marine biology-inspired robotics, anguilliform locomotion, as one of the most common underwater propulsion types, has been widely studied and implemented in many robot prototypes. Most of these robots consisted of rigid parts, and they were able to generate smooth sine waves along the robot body using a great number of rigid segments, electric motors, and complicated control. To simplify the robot structures and improve body compliance, anguilliform robots with a full soft body are highly desirable for better biomimicry. In this article, we propose a serial soft-actuator array consisting of four ﬁber-reinforced, bidirectionally bending, ﬂuidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) to achieve the generation of anguilliform body waves. The FEA is fabricated using the typical soft lithography method with dual-chamber conﬁguration and ﬁber reinforcement. The bending performance of the single FEA in free space with static loads was measured and compared with the three-dimensional simulation results using the ﬁnite element method. After that, the FEA array was assembled using the through-chamber tube connection and tested in water to investigate the bending performance with dynamic loads. Finally, with coordinated control of each segment, this FEA array achieved the generation of anguilliform body waves with different frequencies and amplitudes, which unveils a novel and promising approach to develop an anguilliform underwater robot. By attaching this FEA array to a miniaturized standalone station for control and actuation, an untethered swimming robot was built and successfully propelled by the FEA array, which demonstrates the capabilities and potentials of this soft and slender robot body design.},

Pulse signals with suitable shifting phases are utilized to control delivery of compressed air to the actuators in sequence to create a sinusoidal wave from head to tail of the robot body. A model of hydrodynamic forces acting on an anguilliform swimmer when moving in ﬂuid was built to estimate the thrust force generated by the robot at different tail beat frequencies. Experimental data revealed that the generated thrust force was positively correlated with the beat frequency. Measured data showed that swimming efﬁciency depended on both generated thrust force and body posture in situ. At the beat frequency of 1.25 Hz, and air pressure at three segments from head to tail of 65, 50, and 30 kPa, respectively, the eel robot body showed the best cost of transport (COT) of 19.21 with velocity of 10.5 cm/s (or 0.198 body length per second [BL/s]), compared to the other’s values of operation frequency and air pressure. We also found that control shifting phase strongly affects the swimming speed and COT. The robot body reached the highest velocity at around 19 cm/s (0.36 BL/s) with the COT of 10.72.

	abstract = {Soft robots are often inspired from biological systems which consist of soft materials or are actuated by electrically activated materials. There are several advantages of soft robots compared to the conventional robots; safe human-machine interaction, adaptability to wearable devices, simple gripping system, and so on. Due to the unique features and advantages, soft robots have a considerable range of applications. This article reviews stateof-the-art researches on soft robots and application areas. Actuation systems for soft robots can be categorized and analyzed into three types: variable length tendon, ﬂuidic actuation, and electro-active polymer (EAP). The deformable property of soft robots restricts the use of many conventional rigid sensors such as encoders, strain gauges, or inertial measurement units. Thus, contactless approaches for sensing and/or sensors with low modulus are preferable for soft robots. Sensors include low modulus ({\textless} 1 MPa) elastomers with liquid-phase material ﬁlled channels and are appropriate for proprioception which is determined by the degree of curvature. In control perspective, novel control idea should be developed because the conventional control techniques may be inadequate to handle soft robots. Several innovative techniques and diverse materials \& fabrication methods are described in this review article. In addition, a wide range of soft robots are characterized and analyzed based on the following sub-categories; actuation, sensing, structure, control and electronics, materials, fabrication and system, and applications.},

	abstract = {Many attempts have been made to reproduce theoretically the stress–strain curves obtained from experiments on the isothermal deformation of highly elastic ‘rubberlike' materials. The existence of a strain-energy function has usually been postulated, and the simplifications appropriate to the assumptions of isotropy and incompressibility have been exploited. However, the usual practice of writing the strain energy as a function of two independent strain invariants has, in general, the effect of complicating the associated mathematical analysis (this is particularly evident in relation to the calculation of instantaneous moduli of elasticity) and, consequently, the basic elegance and simplicity of isotropic elasticity is sacrificed. Furthermore, recently proposed special forms of the strain-energy function are rather complicated functions of two invariants. The purpose of this paper is, while making full use of the inherent simplicity of isotropic elasticity, to construct a strain-energy function which: (i) provides an adequate representation of the mechanical response of rubberlike solids, and (ii) is simple enough to be amenable to mathematical analysis.
