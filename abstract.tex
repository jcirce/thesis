\section*{Abstract}
Soft robots, more specifically, soft pneumatic actuators generate bending motion through constraining the soft materials and the amount of inner chambers within each robot. Typically, to achieve multi-directional bending within one robot, we use multiple chambers or multiple soft materials, but the increased complexity and hardware required to control these robots limits mass production and accesibility for the robot. In this work, we present a soft robot capable of multi-directional bending with a single inflatable chamber, made from a single soft material. 

This work documents the process of developing and characterizing this robot and its novel method of achieving the bending behavior. The actuator is made from a single soft material and is capable of bi-directional bending using only positive pressure in a single chamber. This work details the design process, iterations on the fabrication method, the analytical model for bending behavior, the construction of the experimentation rig, and the software developed for characterization. Additionally, this work includes results for bending angle, blocked force, and grasping applications for robots made from 4 soft materials.
