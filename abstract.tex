\section*{Abstract}

Soft robots, specifically soft pneumatic actuators, generate bending motion through asymmetrically constraining the deformation of soft materials. Typically, actuators are fabricated with multiple chambers or soft materials to achieve multi-directional bending within one robot. However, the increased complexity and hardware required to control these robots limit mass production and applicability for the robot. This work presents a circular soft pneumatic actuator capable of bi-directional bending with a single chamber made from a single soft material and a positive pressure source. This work documents the development and characterization of this robot and its novel method of achieving bending behavior. We include the design, iterations of the fabrication process, and the construction of the pressurization equipment. For characterization, we define an analytical model for bending angle with increasing pressure and compare it to experimental results for actuators made from four soft materials. Additionally, we measure the blocked force on the end of an actuator and present results of grasping applications for a single circular actuator.
